#develop-me This needs filled in.
The official documentation, located at https://docs.duckietown.com/daffy/opmanual-duckiebot/assembly/db21m/index.html is the fprimary resource. However, the instructions for the db21m model can be unclear, as it is mostly just words and with no written instructions. So, to supplement that here are some notes on the steps and recommendations others who've build a duckiebot have given. In addition, while the db21j model is slighly different, it is mostly the same so comparing instructions can also help clarity.

Setup: You will likely need a pair of needle nose pliers, and charging the battery takes 5 hours and flashing the SD card can take 2 hours, so do those steps first.
There's a plastic film on the laser cut chassis pieces. If you want to remove it I recommend doing that prior to assembly. 

1. the electronics part is the one rectangular one with only two holes; does not match the image but is the correct part based on the images I believe the larger nylon screws are intended. The holes are larger than the screws by a lot and loose so pay attention to how it’s positioned.

2. even the short screws didn't get on snugly to the stand off, for mine, so perhaps even shorter screws source elsewhere might be better however upon step three there was little wiggle so those might be fine. Alternatively, shorter screws can be found from the ELC shop. 

4. metal nuts here, and found pliers a necessity to get them in

7. and 11, don’t use the extra short screws here

12. start the bottom nut with pliers but don’t fully tighten it as you might have to adjust height for the upper nut.

17. big nylon screws and nuts

18. orientation matters here

23. don’t over tighten, or the angle will be bad

26. one of the longest 3 cables

31. the middle length cable for this step

32. metal screw, make sure the cable is going through the hole indicated

41. short nylon screws small bolts

47. image orientation of the cable doesn’t match what fits
