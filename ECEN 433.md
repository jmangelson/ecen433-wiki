# ECEN 433 - Introduction to Robotic Autonomy

Welcome to ECEN 433 (Temporarily 493R) - Introduction to Robotic Autonomy! 

This is the main website for the course, you can find links to the assignments, schedule, and resources, below.
## Course Overview

An autonomous robot is a complex machine that is able to move within and sense and/or influence its environment with little-or-limited human interaction. Capabilities of these systems have dramatically increased in recent years and robots are now commonly being used to support operations such as autonomous driving, interplanetary/ocean exploration, infrastructure inspection, emergency response, and healthcare. However, a robot is a complex system-of-systems with many interconnected components. In this course, you will learn about the fundamental components or a robotic system and gain hands-on experience developing and debugging a real-world robot.  

In this course, you will get a hands on and theoretical introduction to the field of mobile robotics through the perspective of autonomous driving! To do so, we will be using [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/), as the hardware platform in the course.
